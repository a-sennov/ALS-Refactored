# Advanced Locomotion System Refactored

Fork from [Sixze/ALS-Refactored](https://github.com/Sixze/ALS-Refactored). Contains code used in Vae-Victis game project and may not suit your needs.

* support for non-UE4 skeletons, especially for DAZ 3D characters (skeleton still requires some additional setup, not ditributed with plugin)
* footstep effects settings moved to character, this allows different footstep sounds/footprints/particles for different characters/footwear
* special Locomotion Action for interaction

more changes are on their way...
